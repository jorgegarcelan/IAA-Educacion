We're releasing a revised dark theme for the notebooks editor this week.

Previous dark theme:

There are too very significant advantages to updating datasets: Real world data and overfitting
Predicting data with a timeseries component is as real world as it gets, and much of it is non stationary in the real world.
It is, afaik, impossible to overfit future data, at least without a time machine. Teams will be able to validate over time that their models are actually good versus just lucky (as can happen with private leaderboards with finite datasets).",,

Starting today, we‚Äôre rolling out a new feature that lets you save your notebooks to your GitHub repository (even private ones)!
To enable this feature, go to File &gt; Link to GitHub in the Notebook Editor.  If you haven‚Äôt previously linked your Kaggle and GitHub accounts, you‚Äôll be prompted to do that first.
After that, whenever you save a version, you‚Äôll be able to commit the version to GitHub as well.  Check out this screenshot of the feature in action:

If want to stop saving this notebook to GitHub, go to File &gt; Unlink from GitHub in the Notebook Editor.  If you want Kaggle to stop working with your GitHub data completely, you can unlink your accounts from either your Kaggle account page under ‚ÄúMy linked accounts‚Äù or from GitHub‚Äôs settings pages.
We hope you enjoy this new feature!  Remember, you can also open your notebooks from GitHub repositories, as we posted about here.

To our former InClass hosts: aside from a new name, there are no changes to how you can host and use the InClass competitions you know and love. We‚Äôve even updated our documentation to help you better set up and launch your competition!

As a follow-up from the Scheduled Notebooks Dataset Pipelines feature, we are now releasing an option to automatically update a dataset from a notebook‚Äôs output, whenever a new successful ‚ÄúSave &amp; Run All‚Äù version finishes.
When you create a new dataset from the notebook viewer page, you can opt-in to this option. You can also enable/disable this option on your dataset‚Äôs viewer page on the ‚ÄúMetadata‚Äù tab.

This is an exciting feature in combination with the Scheduled Notebooks for users who want to automatically update their dataset. 
We cannot wait to see how you will use this feature in interesting ways. Check out this example scheduled notebook ‚ÄúReliance Stock Prices with News Sentiment‚Äù which updates this dataset automatically each time it runs.
Check out this detailed post with more examples if you're looking for more inspiration.

We know Kaggle Learn Courses are a key resource for many of you who are just stepping into or furthering your expertise in data science. Along with a new design for each course page, we‚Äôre announcing new Discussion forums for each course. 
If you're stumped or have questions about a course, you can reach the Kaggle community through the course forum. You can also browse through posts to see helpful answers from other learners.
The course forums can be accessed from the discussion tab of each course. This change is gradually rolling out to the community, so if you don‚Äôt see it now, you can expect to see it soon!

You can receive email notifications alerting you to new posts in any forum you choose to follow. Here‚Äôs how:

Navigate to a course page.
Select the Discussion tab.
Click the Follow button.

(With this new approach to course discussions, we will be removing the old Kaggle Learn forum. You will still be able to find your previous course posts in the Getting Started forum.)
We hope the new course discussions will become a more focused and helpful resource to help you navigate through and get the most out of Kaggle courses. If you have any feedback we‚Äôd love to hear it! Let us know by leaving a comment on this post.",1.0,11/29/2021

As promised in our Schedule your notebooks! post we‚Äôre releasing a new feature this week. 
You can now choose to schedule your notebook to run whenever an attached Dataset or Notebook Output updates with a new version.
We hope you can leverage this feature in exciting new ways, like building dataset processing pipelines. For example, check out this notebook on vaccination rates which runs when the dependent datasets update.

We have included some limits to allow our compute resources to support the increased demand:

Scheduled notebooks run at most once per day, any additional updates will be coalesced and queued to run the next day. Runs will use the latest version of all attached datasets.
These notebooks count towards the 1 Private and 5 Public notebooks that can be scheduled at this time.
Competition datasets do not normally update and therefore are not supported for run on update triggers.

We‚Äôre excited to see your ideas, please share your experiences in this thread!",1.0,11/02/2021

  Having Data visible OR Notebook is not great‚Ä¶previously you could view both and if needed to search had both available

I'd like to understand how you used this a bit more. Could you share a specific notebook and describe how this had been useful to you? It sounds like you're using a browser search (CTRL + F) to look for something across both a notebook and dataset at the same time, and this is no longer possible because you can't show both on the screen at once. Is that correct?

  Also might be nice to report some stats on these ""often requested new features"" and the numbers actually coding on mobile devices.

I'll bring it up with the team if we can publish something into the Meta Kaggle Dataset.
A significant amount of people use mobile devices or tablets to read up on competitions, view notebooks / datasets, participate in discussions, take learn courses, etc. Roughly 20% of people use a mobile device (phone or tablet) as their primary way to engage with Kaggle.
While there may not be a majority of people writing code on a mobile device, hundreds of thousands of notebook sessions are run on mobile devices every day. We are a global and diverse community, and learning from data should be open to everyone.
For many Kagglers, they don't have a choice, and only have access to a phone or tablet, so that is what they use. This is sometimes due to financial reasons, other times this is due to regional reasons. In some countries, traditional internet infrastructure doesn't exist, so having a phone or tablet is the only practical way of doing things; you can't even buy a laptop (and also wouldn't want one because it isn't useful).",3.0,09/29/2021

Beginning this week, you‚Äôll be able to schedule your notebooks to run automatically from the notebook editor. You can schedule your notebook to run daily, weekly or monthly.
We hope you find creative ways to utilize this new feature, from keeping your notebook fresh to scraping and updating your Kaggle datasets and more. For example, checkout this scheduled notebook EDA on COVID Panel or this template for automatically updating a dataset.

We have included some limits to allow our compute resources to support the increased demand:

Only CPU notebooks can be scheduled (not GPU/TPU).
1 Private and 5 Public notebooks can be scheduled at this time.
Schedules expire after a maximum of 10 runs after which they need to be reset.

We‚Äôre excited to see your ideas, please share your experiences in this thread!
Coming up next:

Released! Schedule your notebook to run when datasets it depends on are updated

The team has been hard at work to bring you the re-imagined Notebook Viewer. In addition to adopting the patterns and conventions we use across Kaggle, we've also included some often requested new features.
This update will be slowly rolling out over the upcoming weeks, so if you don't have the experience just yet, we appreciate your patience. Update: This should be rolled out to everyone now.
The new look

With the introduction of tabs, you can read notebooks in a distraction free environment. You'll still have access to explore a notebook's data sources, execution logs, and comments only a click away.
Managing your notebooks

With the Settings tab, managing your notebooks has never been easier. Here you'll find controls over your sharing settings, as well as making quick updates to notebook title and pin versions.
Improved mobile experience

We've paid extra attention to the mobile experience, so you can read and interact with notebooks effortlessly on the go.
Other features

View and compare versions using the same experience from the Notebook Editor
Maximize your reading area, by collapsing the table of contents
Combined input and output data explorer
Faster loading times
‚Ä¶and much more!

Just saw this was the latest changes to Notebooks and thought could be some connection (in general tend to troubleshoot issues that way - if something changed is it related?).

has something happened with font style and size in Notebooks when editing? or missing stylesheets? 
pretty tiny atm even dark mode is actually worse. zoom out is ok-ish but navigating elsewhere is then gigantic.
wrt these changes - commit+ submit is that an option or will always happen?  sometimes think you would prefer to see how something ran before burning a submission.  will wait to see how this looks and know a lot of people have wanted a commit + submit option. not sure that is always great for all competitions and especially close to them ending. if there is an error, will the submission be error also?  and if you have used up your daily submissions, then you cannot do a commit?",,

During this past summer, our intern  worked hard to build a simplified flow for submitting notebooks to a competition.  Over the next few days, you‚Äôll start to see the associated changes in the Notebook Editor.
First, there‚Äôs a new ‚ÄúCompetitions‚Äù side pane in your notebook, which appears when there is a single competition data source attached.  It provides a convenient location to see the best and latest score from that notebook, as well as your team‚Äôs daily submission count.

Clicking on the submit button will open a modal where you can view the details of your submission.  Submitting from here will do two things: create a new version of your notebook and submit the new version to the competition.
Helpful tips:

For code competitions, the ‚Äúcommit + submit‚Äù actions will happen concurrently, since we don‚Äôt need to wait for the version to create an output file. No more waiting for your commit to finish before you can submit!
In most competitions your submission needs to be named ‚Äúsubmission.csv‚Äù to use this functionality. We specify the name of the file in the modal so that we know which output file to score after notebook execution.
Your submission will still be subject to all the existing competitions checks, such as daily submission limits.


Additionally, in order to make tracking this easier, we‚Äôve also added notifications to the Active Events pane, which you can learn about in our recent announcement.
We hope you enjoy this new feature!

You'll receive a notification here when a submission to a classic or code competition is being processed, when it‚Äôs complete, or if there‚Äôs an error. As always, you‚Äôll continue to see events for your active notebooks and dataset uploads.

My starting point is to get it working locally, in a conda environment, with Jupyter notebooks, and then try and mirror that setup in Kaggle Notebooks. Try these steps:

lets say I have a module called competition_util which has all my common functions, step one is to select the competition you are interested in, then the Code page, and then hit the New Notebook button
now double click on the generated and editable notebook name, top left, and call it competition_util
next go to File menu -&gt; Editor Type an select Script (this is key!!), then copy &amp; paste your Python module code from your IDE or local file editor (this code is just a simple Python module with imports, functions and classes; it is not a package hierarchy) and paste it into the Kaggle script editor
finally, again from the File menu, choose Set as Utility Script

Next we want to save a version of our script, so our notebook can reference it, and then import it at runtime:

go to the File menu, chose Save Version
in the save version dialogue, on the drop-down, choose Quick Save (optionally you can change the version label above the drop-down, possibly to match any VCS version in your local file system)
finally hit the Save button

Now we can move to our notebook, which you may have open in another browser tab, so next:

If the notebook doesn't exist yet, you again want to select the competition, then the Code page, and hit the New Notebook button
from the File menu, select Add utility script
in the dialogue pane, select the competition_util script, to be imported
now you can import fuctions from your module, e.g.: from competition_util import load_data_point_table and in code you can reference load_data_point_table() as a local function, bingo! 

BTW when typing the import ... statement, you can just hit  and the notebook editor should give you code completion and show you the functions available in the module, proving that the previous Add utility script step worked üòè",3.0,08/05/2021

We‚Äôre pleased to share that we‚Äôve at last upgraded our R Docker images to R 4.x. New R notebooks that you create will use this version of R. If you edit or fork older R notebooks, they‚Äôll continue to use the same Docker image version they were created with. If you‚Äôd like to update older R notebooks to the latest version of R (and other packages), you can select ‚ÄúAlways use latest environment‚Äù from the Environment Preferences dialog in the editor (read more here).
R 4 introduced many new features and behavior changes. You can read about all of them here, but some of the highlights from the release notes include:

R now uses a stringsAsFactors = FALSE default, and hence by default no longer converts strings to factors in calls to data.frame() and read.table()
New function list2DF() for creating data frames from lists of variables
The palette() function has a new default set of colours (which are less saturated and have better accessibility properties)

If you run into any issues with the latest R 4.x environment in R notebooks, let us know in the replies to this post.
Happy Kaggling!

The big changes here are search and filtering are front and center, card and list views, better discovery and share-ability with filters, and more useful metadata for competitions you are actively participating in. 

Behind the scenes we‚Äôve migrated some very old routes to the API pattern used by most of modern Kaggle, which will enable us to release a more useful and powerful user SDK in the future. 
Go check it out yourself at kaggle.com/competitions (or any other listings on Competitions, Datasets, or your profile). If you still see the old style, try again tomorrow. We‚Äôre gradually rolling out the new design in the upcoming days.
Bookmarks
We are migrating the ‚Äòpinned‚Äô system to a site-wide ‚Äòbookmark‚Äô system. You can find bookmarked competitions on your profile. You can migrate previously pinned competitions to bookmarks in the ‚ÄúBookmarks‚Äù tab on your profile page
What‚Äôs next?
I‚Äôm sure we have changed some much-loved features and expectations, so we will be carefully listening to y‚Äôalls feedback in the coming weeks to land on a final version.
Huge thanks to
 for design and UX.
 for answering all my (way too many) questions and providing some critical user perspective.
 and  for testing and feedback.
 for product feedback and implementing many features on the backend
 for the Bookmarks implementation
  and  for reviewing code.
We would love to hear your thoughts. If there are any improvements or changes you‚Äôd like to see in this new layout let us know in the comments.

This means that when you edit or fork a notebook, you‚Äôll be able to view/edit it without consuming any GPU/TPU quota. When you‚Äôre ready to start testing it out, just run a cell like you normally would and your notebook will automatically start up and then execute the cells you‚Äôve queued up.

Here's an example of how it should be working: 
I've reported this issue with your notebook not allowing unhiding in the viewer, but we're all off until Monday so it will be fixed then.

 explained how to 'collapse/expand' a cell in the editor. This only applies to the editor, not the viewer, so cells collapsed in the editor will be expanded in the viewer.
Kaggle also has the concept of hide/show input/output cells in the viewer. See  and if you mark a cell to be hidden in the viewer, it will by default be collapsed when shown in the viewer, but the user can click 'expand' on it in the viewer to read that code/output as always.
All of the editor upgrades were UI/UX changes to the editor only, we didn't impact how kernel execution, Save Versions, or the viewer works as part of this upgrade, so rest assured Kaggle still works the way you know :)",3.0,04/24/2021

In the old notebook editor we had two options on how we would like to display our notebook cells upon publishing a public notebook:

leave everything as is and viewer/visitors of the notebook could see both the input/code cell and output cell 
hide either or both but still viewers/visitors of the notebook could see what they want by just clicking 

But now (if I am not missing something) I could either display either/both cells or hide them completely.  This is forcing people FORKING a notebook in order to see how something is coded. I have no problem with people forking my notebook. They can do so as many times as they please, but this is leading them (in my humble opinion) to forget upvoting a notebook which they found helpful/useful.

Over the next few days, we‚Äôll be rolling out a couple of features that offer you more options for sharing your notebooks.  These new features can be found in the Notebook Viewer of public notebooks when you hover over a code or markdown cell:

The Cell Linking control on the left (paperclip icon) enables you to refer directly to a part of the notebook.  It copies a link to your clipboard that will scroll directly back to that cell in the notebook viewer.
The Embed Notebook control on the right (angle bracket icon) enables you to share this notebook outside of Kaggle.  Clicking here will open a dialog box that enables you to customize an iframe tag.

When you‚Äôre ready, click the Copy icon and paste it into your external site or blog.  Users who visit your site will see the contents of the notebook inline with your own content, like this:

We‚Äôre excited to introduce simplified access to four pretrained Google Cloud AI services:
Cloud Translation
Natural Language
Video Intelligence
Vision
These will complement our existing integration with Cloud Storage, BigQuery and AutoML.
To use those services, you only need to authenticate an existing Google Cloud account and instantiate the corresponding API client from your notebook. For example, you can access the Cloud Natural Language API with the following two lines:
from google.cloud import language_v1
client = language_v1.LanguageServiceClient()

(note: you don‚Äôt need to provide any GCP credentials in your code) 
Please note that pretrained Google Cloud AI services are paid services and require a GCP project with billing enabled. You're eligible for a $300 credit when creating your account and your first GCP project.
To start using these services, you must have a Google Cloud project that has the service API enabled.

Select or create a GCP Project
Enable Billing. Remember to review pricing prior to this step.
Enable API(s) by following one or more links
Enable Cloud Translation API
Enable Cloud Natural Language API
Enable Video Intelligence API
Enable Cloud Vision API

Once these APIs are set up, attach your Google Cloud Platform account to your notebook. Select 'Add-ons' in the menu, then 'Google Cloud Services'.

If you have already attached your Google Cloud account to your Kaggle account, just attach it to your notebook as well.

Make sure the ‚Äò'Google Cloud AI Platform' checkbox is enabled on the linked account.

To make your journey easier, we prepared tutorial notebooks for each API. These tutorials guide you through the main features of Google Cloud AI services.

Cloud Translation quick start notebook

List available languages
Translate text
Determine the source language of your text
Cloud Natural Language quick start notebook

Sentiment analysis
Content classification
Identify well-known entities (inventors, artists, etc)
Cloud Video Intelligence quick start notebook

Annotate video
Detect person or logo
Cloud Vision quick start notebook

Object detection and classification
Detect emotional state on human face

And of course you can combine those APIs in the same notebook for more complex use cases.
We hope this enables more use cases for your ML tasks. Please leave any feedback you have for us below! Happy Kaggling.",1.0,06/04/2021

Beginning this week, we‚Äôre starting to roll out some changes to Kaggle‚Äôs notebook editor to a small percentage of users. Most of these are behind the scenes changes to migrate from the classic Jupyter API to the JupyterLab one, but there are also a few exciting new features.
Find helpful actions in the context menu
You can now find many helpful actions in the context menu by right-clicking in the editor pane. When available, keyboard shortcuts are also provided here.

Cut, copy, paste, and delete cells 
Split and merge cells
Control cell visibility and type
Control cell outputs
Control output scrolling
Undo, redo, and restart kernel

 
Drag cells
Easily reorder you cells by dragging them. Just press and hold in the left margin of the cell as you drag the cell where you want it to go.
 
Everything else
There are a few other enhancements and changes worth mentioning:

More responsive tab completion
Updated styling for the toolbar and code / markdown add buttons

As we roll out the updated editor, we‚Äôll be monitoring for performance regressions and any other issues. Please let us know if you have any feedback or encounter any issues. Depending on how things go, it may be a few days or a week before you see the updates. We‚Äôll update this post when it‚Äôs fully rolled out to all users.

We're happy to announce a new feature to open notebooks from a source file on GitHub.
You can find this feature in the Kaggle notebook editor in the new Open Notebook dialog accessible under File &gt; Open Notebook in the top menu.

Coming Soon
Very soon you will be able to open a notebook from a file saved in a private GitHub repository. We will also add a feature to export your Kaggle notebook to a GitHub repository.
We would love to hear your thoughts and feedback in the comments on this feature or to the upcoming improvements.
Thanks to  &amp;  for their work on this feature.
Cheers!

Last week, the Notebooks team held its quarterly fixit.  In total, the team knocked out an impressive 34 bugs and feature requests in just 5 days!  Here are some of the new features you may have noticed:
We added the ability to restart just the notebook instead of the entire VM.  Not only is this faster, it also preserves any VM changes you‚Äôve made (like output files) while still allowing you to start with fresh memory.

Ever wanted to edit an old version of your code?  Now you can! Just open the editor versions list and select ‚ÄúRevert to version‚Äù.  This will replace your current working draft with the selected version‚Äôs code, without restarting the session.

We also fixed a bunch of annoying UI issues, including removing incorrect warnings and tidying up visual inconsistencies.  We did some strictly internal cleanups too, which should enable us to deliver features even faster in the future!

Hello Kagglers,
Beginning today we‚Äôre introducing a new page to improve how you browse and search for public notebooks on Kaggle! There are some big changes to how you find notebooks, so we‚Äôll use this post to walk through the updates as well as ask for your feedback.
Browse public code
When you navigate to the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù page on Kaggle-- see a topic-oriented layout showcasing cards featuring popular and ‚Äúhot‚Äù notebooks and scripts shared by Kagglers. Browse the different cards and click ‚ÄúSee more‚Äù to filter to that topic. 
You can also search, filter, and sort to narrow your query. Even more improvements to searching for code on Kaggle are coming soon!
Finally, click ‚ÄúYour Work‚Äù at the top if you want to instead find something you created, shared with you, or your own favorites. This will take you to the ‚ÄúYour Work‚Äù section on your profile. As always, you can find your work on Dataset and Competition pages, too, by clicking on the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù tab.

‚ÄúCode‚Äù: A new name for this page
You‚Äôll notice that we named the page ‚ÄúCode‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúNotebooks‚Äù (both the title and the left navigation). This change is carried over to the code listing for Dataset pages, Competitions pages, as well as your profile. The update includes a change to the URL as well (e.g., kaggle.com/notebooks is now kaggle.com/code).
You can keep calling notebooks you create ‚Äúnotebooks‚Äù and scripts are still ‚Äúscripts‚Äù, of course. But we feel ‚ÄúCode‚Äù is a better name for the page that‚Äôs inclusive of all types of code that‚Äôs created and shared on Kaggle, not just notebooks.
Changes to navigating to ‚ÄúYour Work‚Äù
One of the biggest changes is removing private work from the code discovery page at kaggle.com/code and we want to take some time to describe the motivation behind this decision. 
If you‚Äôd like to understand more about this change as well as provide us with feedback about future improvements we want to make here, check out this special product feedback forum post.

Have feedback? Let us know!
If you have any questions or feedback about browsing and searching for public notebooks and scripts on Kaggle, let us know in the replies! If you have feedback about upcoming plans for improving ‚ÄúYour Work‚Äù, check out this separate post. 
Thanks and happy Kaggling!

Have you ever come across a dataset that complements a competition that you wish to share with the world? Or, maybe you have a process that transforms the competition data into a different or more usable format?  Now you can link these datasets to a competition by using the datasets-on-competitions feature.
You can find and add to the new datasets listing in the top menu of each competition.

If you have a dataset you would like to share, simply click on the ‚ÄúAdd Dataset‚Äù button and go through the attached process.

We can't wait to see the datasets all of you share on competitions with this new feature! Please let us know if you have any questions or feedback in the comments below.

Would it be possible for you to add a field to each run of a notebook version where the user could either add metadata about that version (why/what was done special there? what parameters were of interest? note hyperparameters, etc.)? 
If you could make it at least a json like comment file that will be very helpful to keep track of what one did in each notebook. The user could just download this notebook-version-metadata.json and keep track of all those json files in another notebook. 

  For instance, I would like to just download all those notebook-version-metadata.json files using another kaggle kernel and load them with pandas and outer-join them to get a nice all-encompassing dashboard; save the consolidated data as a csv file and download it.

One more thing could be very handy is if you could also make the (notes: notebook-version-metadata) available in the submissions view. For instance, they would only expand, when one clicks on them.
As an added feature, you could perhaps also allow the user to select a few submission files and compare them against their respective notes.

Are you looking to cut down the training time of your TensorFlow model? Or increase the number of parameters in your model beyond what can be trained within the Kaggle Notebooks environment limits? Or maybe you have a model you would like to use in production with real users, without having to manage your own prediction serving infrastructure?
Today, we are launching a new integration between Kaggle's notebook environment and TensorFlow Cloud which will allow you to train &amp; deploy your model on Google Cloud AI Platform.

To use this integration, you'll need a billing-enabled Google Cloud project. If you don't already have one, you can check out this great tutorial on how to create a project. New accounts qualify for $300 in starting credits!
We have prepared two walkthrough notebooks to showcase this new feature:

The Train a Model with TensorFlow Cloud notebook teaches you how to attach your Google Cloud credentials to your notebook, and write training code that can be run both in a Kaggle notebook and on Google Cloud.
The Test &amp; Deploy TensorFlow Model to AI Platform notebook shows how to load a pre-trained model, test it, deploy it to Google Cloud AI Platform, and use the scalable Prediction API to generate predictions without having to manage your own infrastructure.

We‚Äôre really looking forward to hearing your feedback as you try this feature and how we can help you improve your experience. Please feel free to drop us a comment below and happy Kaggling!

We‚Äôre pleased to announce that we‚Äôve added a new way of creating Datasets. You can now use an existing Google Cloud Storage location (either a bucket or a storage path prefix) to create new Datasets or versions. Once you start the creation of your dataset, our platform will automatically pull all files in that location and pack them into a Dataset on Kaggle.

Like with the other types of remote data sources, you can also schedule these Datasets to update automatically.

Please note that this only works for public buckets. All regular limits for Datasets apply.

The default notebook sort by best score is changed to ""Descending"". This is fine with metrics like ROC AUC, Accuracy, etc, but not Log loss (e.g. MoA competition). The old notebook layout knew how to sort depended on each metric used by the competition. 
Score UI is too small. When we sort by score we usually compare score between notebooks, but with the new UI it is too hard. Please highlight it as the old one, it's good.
Highlight and make the space between All, Your Work, etc. equals. The new one is nice, but All is just too small compares to the other ones.

2- The notebook's score is not highlighted anymore, it was nice to have the score highlighted, especially in competitions.

Those are the 2 main factors that catch your attention in competitions where dozens of notebooks are published everyday, it's the kind of information you wanna grasp at the first glimpse!

First things first - Hallo! I‚Äôm a new (gosling?) engineer on the Kaggle team focused on making kaggle.com responsive, beautiful, and useful. I had previously worked on various Nest and Google Home projects for a number of years. I‚Äôm super excited to be working on Kaggle, learning more about data science, and participating in this awesome community. 
A New Look
If a picture is worth a 1000 words, a gif should be at least 2000. This update uses our new design system to make it simpler to use the notebooks listing. Search is also more prominent. Click on the filter icon to filter by tags or other parameters. Plus, you can copy and edit and more directly from the listing now by clicking on the ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù menu.

Go check it out yourself at kaggle.com/notebooks (or any other listings on Competitions, Datasets, or your profile). If you still see the old style, try again tomorrow. We‚Äôre gradually rolling out the new design this week.
Where‚Äôs my GPU/TPU quota?
GPU/TPU quota has moved to our new notifications panel! Hopefully this will provide a more consistent way to check this important information no matter where you are on the site. 

Where are my active notebook sessions?
Previously if you had active notebook sessions running, you could stop or edit them from the top of the notebook listing. We‚Äôve removed this card and replaced it with the new Active Events window located at the bottom of the left-hand navigation. Read more about this feature here:

What‚Äôs next? 
You might have noticed new buttons, avatars, and other styles being updated site-wide. This is the first large-scale update we‚Äôve launched which utilizes that same underlying work. We‚Äôve heard loud and clear that confusion caused by inconsistent behavior across Kaggle‚Äôs product areas is a pain point for many Kagglers. This project is a step towards addressing that inconsistency. You can expect more updates like this one in the near future. 
Huge thanks to 
  and  for design. 
 for answering all my (way too many) questions and driving the project forward.  for catching some tricky edge cases in testing.
   and  for implementing various features, components, and reviewing code. 
This project really did take a gaggle.

We‚Äôre thrilled to be launching a new way to track your active events on Kaggle. Starting with notebooks today, many of you will begin to see a section at the bottom of the left side panel that shows your active events. 
All events in one place
Previously on Kaggle, you had no way to easily see the status of long running events like running notebooks. This forced you to either stay on the active job page or navigate between pages to check the status of your notebooks. Especially when you can have several concurrent notebooks at a time, this can be a pain. Now, we have an active events section in the left navigation to consolidate statuses for all active events. In this first release you‚Äôll be able to see the status of all your interactive and running notebooks. 

Track and take action
As your events run you‚Äôll see the window update in real time. As you track your events you can also take action on them. When a notebook is running you can open the notebook by clicking on ‚Äúedit‚Äù. You can also stop an interactive notebook or session by selecting ‚Äústop session‚Äù.

Coming Soon
Very soon we‚Äôll also be launching this feature into the notebooks editor so that you can track events no matter where you are on Kaggle. We also plan on adding even more events for things like competition submissions and dataset uploads so that you can see all longer running jobs in one place.
We would love to hear your thoughts. If there are any improvements you‚Äôd like to see in this new feature let us know in the comments.
Thanks to   and  for their work on this feature.

I am just trying to upload some model weights that can be accessed by a notebook. After two hours of reading docs, watching youtube videos, clicking links at random, and navigating around in circles, I am no closer to accomplishing this than when I started. Before I check myself into the stupid farm, may I ask a few basic questions?
1) Does a dataset own a notebook or a notebook own a dataset or neither or both? (One one page it offered to start a notebook for this dataset.)
2) When a dataset is brought into the data area (???) of a notebook, is there a specific directory structure I am required to use? It seems like the dataset always ends up under ""Input""-&gt;dataset name-&gt;dataset files&amp;folders. Can the dataset files exist in any different hierarchy than this relative to the notebooks?
3) Are private notebooks in any kind of specific place, i.e., filed under a competition, or are they held in an unstructured blob or list?
4) Can a Jupyter notebook invoke a different notebook, as in ""%run Startup.ipynb""? How/where are the invoking notebook and Startup.ipynb in relationship to each other?
5) What about ""from myUtils.showType import showit""? Can I make a directory of .py files (myUtils) that are available to Jupyter notebooks? Links to how-to docs would be sufficient explanation.

In the Notebooks Listing:

You can edit your notebooks directly from the listing, skipping the viewer.
You can filter your notebooks by privacy.

The Submit button on an Output File in the Notebook Viewer page (the traditional flow)
The options menu (ellipsis) on the Notebook Viewer page
The options menu (ellipsis) on the Notebook Editor's Version History page

In the future we'll be building a similar workflow for file upload-based competitions and competitions that allow both types of submissions.

969789,174527,495305,2020-08-14 00:19:49,,"Hi Kagglers,
I‚Äôve been part of Kaggle since 2015 and for as long as I can remember, reliability and stability of Kaggle Notebooks has been a top pain point. Thanks to your feedback, over the past 6+ months we‚Äôve invested more than ever before in making improvements. 
Since the community‚Äôs input has been so critical for us, I wanted to share with you our reflection on the progress we‚Äôve recently made to improve reliability. We know we still have lots of work to do, so I‚Äôll tell you about our takeaways. 
Our approach
We wanted to improve the reliability of the notebooks service itself as well as how reliable you, the user of notebooks, perceive it to be. Here‚Äôs a summary of how we approached this systematically:

We maintained a dedicated working group to address a backlog of issues and monitor and respond to your feedback here on the product feedback forum.
We implemented a new scalable, highly available backend architecture (read about it from Mod, the technical lead on the project) with multiregion support.
We shipped features to improve perceived reliability like ‚Äúsessionless editing‚Äù, a brand new save workflow, and better session start/stop controls in the UI. 

The most noticeable improvement was the sessionless editing feature that we released in June. This required a significant re-architecture of the editor, but once we got things into a stable state, we reduced the editor initialization time from half a minute at the 50th percentile (and over a minute at the 95th) to just seconds.
To measure the impact of the changes we made, our reliability working group created dashboards to monitor and set goals against some key metrics like availability and time-to-edit latency. You may have also received our one-question ‚Äúreliability survey‚Äù, too. Starting in Q1, we are sending this survey each quarter to get a quantifiable sense of what issues you experience. This is the reflection I want to share with you below.
The results
This chart shows the overall results of the survey.

Obviously reliability (i.e., ‚ÄúNotebook session was unreliable‚Äù) is still a top pain point. 
But did our team at least make improvements in the right direction? This chart below shows the percentage change from Q1 to Q2 in the percentage of respondents to the reliability survey who experience each issue. 

Because most of these items are issues (i.e., pain points), an increase from Q1 to Q2 is generally bad (red) whereas a decrease is generally good (blue). Only some of the changes are actually significant (the solid-filled bars).
We saw statistically significant decreases in respondents to the survey mentioning:

üìâ 33%: Can't depend on notebooks to do serious work
üìâ 19%: Session was unreliable
üìâ 18%: Session was slow

Even though reliability still remains a top concern and we have work to do, we were glad to see that (at least according to these survey results) we‚Äôre making progress.
Takeaways
The biggest takeaway is that we‚Äôre not done yet, but we‚Äôre trending in the right direction. Based on our results so far, we intend to maintain our dedicated reliability working group, set new goals, and continue to listen to your feedback. 
Please continue to let us know when you have problems with notebooks and feel free to suggest ideas for us to consider. We truly couldn‚Äôt do this without your input and your patience. Massive thank you!
And huge thanks to the notebooks team who contributed to this effort: Aurelio, Jim, Dustin, Cole, Philippe (Mod), Michael, Vincent, Erdal, Einav, Chelsea.",1.0,08/14/2020

What does floating quota mean here? Just time changing week by week based on overall use? What causes it to change, and by same for all do you mean right now everyone got 39 hours?
If there is some unspent time available in the Google cloud that you are making use of, I would have though it might show some ""spot"" pricing type floating extra time. But now you still need to be able to optimize a week ahead.. Though I guess you can still limit total resources and use queues if running out of them.
So can we expect a competition to predict Kaggle GPU usage time for setting float time, and modelling how changing the floating time changes that dynamic? :)",,

- papermill runs the notebook, this updates the ipynb to include the cell output

So to sum it up: 


papermill runs to notebook
the output (I guess some kind of .ipynb file?) is then passed to your customized nbconvert
An HTML is produced
Apply some code to ""clean up"" the HTML. Is this done using some beautiful soup or the likes? Do you have a CSS theme?

965704,173801,2039816,2020-08-10 19:30:26,965687.0," Happy to!

This was always a consequence of the fact that we always used nbconvert to execute notebooks and convert them to HTML. However, nbconvert does not print cell output as it runs, there's an open issue for this on their github project bug. 

The workarounds are basically to use wrapper libraries around nbconvert that do support this, we ended up going with papermill.

Of course it would be too easy if that was just a 'drop-in' replacement, but I also had to:
- Make sure papermill was installed in at least all environments starting from some date
- Adjust papermill execution settings to closely match our customizations for nbconvert
- Papermill only does notebook execution, not conversion, so I still needed to run nbconvert on the 'finished' notebooks to produce the HTML you see for ""Saved"" notebooks.
- ""Clean up"" changes papermill makes to notebooks that would make it look inconsistent with existing notebooks

It took awhile for us to find the time to experiment with all of these, testing and figuring out the right combination of settings to make the transitions seamless and reliable.",3.0,08/10/2020

Starting today, we‚Äôre testing a ‚Äúfloating‚Äù quota for GPU hours. This means that depending on demand, we may be able to provide more than 30 hours of quota in a given week. 

We are testing this to experiment with offering more compute hours when resources permit. The floating quota will generally work the same way as it does today. Below are some FAQs.

How do I know how much quota I have?
You can check your user account. It's also shown at the top of the notebooks listings and in the editor right-hand pane.

When does the quota reset?
It will reset weekly on Saturday morning (midnight UTC) the same way it always has. It may or may not change week to week (this depends on demand and resource availability).

Does this apply to TPUs, too?
TPUs are a separate resource and the floating quota doesn‚Äôt apply.

Does everyone get the same quota?
Yes, the same floating quota applies to all users.

We hope that it gives you greater flexibility from time to time to do more with Kaggle Notebooks. But, we also recognize that it may make managing quota a bit more complex so for now this is just a trial. Please let us know what you think in the replies!

 your analogy fit perfectly for me thanks. 

I found a colab notebook template that I was able to fairly easily use the kaggle api to transfer the dataset I was playing with and start playing with tensorboard.

When I start a new problem I'll spend a bit more time trying to get the tunneling approach to work. 

Thanks ",,
956500,89671,2039816,2020-08-03 14:46:46,948270.0," Tim ( is correct in that 4s is added to every single sessions Starting time, regardless of it if uses tensorflow. This doesn't sound like a lot of time but it is a lot when you're trying to make the experience as quick and smooth as possible. It also surprisingly adds up to a lot of compute hours / day because of the large number of sessions we run.
There is one change to Tim's explanation, which changed around a month ago when we updated the UI. Previously, yes this meant everyone waited an extra 4s to start editing their notebook, however now you can begin editing your notebook while it is ""Starting"", but you cannot execute cells until it reaches ""Running"". This sounds simple but was actually fairly difficult to accomplish.
This does mean that the extra 4s would be spent waiting to execute cells, but you could still be editing during that time.
I did add some notes to our internal issue for re-enabling tensorflow, we probably just need to decide between:

turning it back on normally, paying the 4s 'execute cells startup time' on every load
adding some sort of reverse-proxy / port opening system to make accessing tensorboard easier.

We'll probably take a look at this during an upcoming planning meeting.",,
956300,89671,5495017,2020-08-03 11:53:38,948270.0,"I agree with Dustin on this one. If I understand correctly, this 4 second delay happens during the ""Session is starting..."" phase where you can't even see, read or edit the content of the notebook. It would apply every single time you open any notebook ‚Äì&nbsp;no mattter if you are using tensorflow or not.

Forcing this delay on all non-tensorflow based notebooks would add up quickly. And while adding a few more seconds to Kernel startup times (Draft Session starting...), loading the Notebook should be as instantaneous as possible.

I reckon the solution would be to find a user-friendly way to reverse-proxy out through Kaggle infrastructure without needing to go through external servers.

A quick analogy of how the two mentioned notebooks work would be something like this: Imagine Alice and Bob would like to talk to each other. They both have a phone that can be used to place calls, but they can't receive any. Because Alice can't call Bob directly, Bob instead calls Robert the reverse proxy. People like Alice can now call Robert and have him put the call through to Bob.
Except that Alice is your Browser, Bob is your Kaggle Notebook Kernel, and the outgoing-only telephone is an Internet Connection behind a Firewall that doesn't allow you to open any ports.

If you describe the problems you're having with tunneling out in a bit more detail (perhaps in a comment under that notebook), I'd be happy to see if I can help.",3.0,08/03/2020

Please excuse my naievte but ~4 second delay dosnt seem like a bad price to pay given that in order to use tensorboard now requires a lengthy set up to use a feature thats pretty much 'built in' to the tensorflow framework. 

I would argue that tunneling out isnt a reasonable solution as the solutions that have been provided in the links above don't appear to work outside of the examples provided (for me atleast) . 

Now these issues im facing may be a combinition of not understanding how tunneling works or genearal lack of experience. Either way i cant seem to get the tunneling solution to work.

Were there any other reasons that the feature got removed?

Just putting
python
%load_ext tensorboard

into a new Kaggle notebook with current environment seems to spawn a TensorBoard instance just fine. The only caveat seems to be, that the port it is available under is not exposed to the outside. For examples of how TensorBoard can be accessed right now by tunneling out through to some kind of reverse proxy have a look at these two notebooks:

Jupyter takes a little time to start the server (about 2s), and users are stuck in starting state in the editor during that time. We work pretty hard to minimize that wait time. 

Jupyter extensions like tensorboard increase jupyter server boot time because extensions are loaded during boot. Tensprboard in particular often takes at least 4 seconds to load because it does a ton of work when its python module is imported. If it deferred that work to after jupyter started, it would not delay boot times.

We were paying this extra 4s, at least tripleing start times, for every single notebook start, and most of these never used tensorboard, so it was wasted time for those users. So we turned it off, with plans to turn it back one whenever we found a way to make it not impact start times.",,

Currently the notebook does not reload even if session was reset, which is a bit confusing as you don't always know which cells were executed in the current or the old session.

What I would really like to see is a way to control multiple sessions for a single kernel. This used to be easy to do by changing the parameters of your model, committing the kernel, then reloading page. You could then modify the parameters and commit again.

From there you can change two new settings, one for each type of version.
- For Quick Saves, you can save your output files.  Now you don't have to wait for a Save &amp; Run All just to recreate a file you already have.
- For Save &amp; Run All Versions, you can choose an accelerator.  This gives you more control over how you manage your GPU and TPU quota, since you can write code in the interactive session without the accelerator and then only use it for a batch run.

The release notes contain a diff between it and the previous release (additions, deletions, and package version changes). You can use this to see when a package is updated to its latest version, for example. For significant releases, we‚Äôll specify this in the title (e.g., TensorFlow 2.2).



We do a lot of work behind the scenes to make sure the environment your code runs in has the latest versions of the most popular R and Python packages. We hope that this provides more transparency into our release process.

Let us know if you have questions or feedback in the comments!

Happy Kaggling,

I understand that the first time I run the python file, it will download a bunch of datasets that would take a lot of time. Do you recommend we create a CPU instance, download the files and then change the instance type to GPU (I tried that but couldn't find an option to upgrade machine type from CPU to GPU, I'm using us-west1-b).
While I try to run the first cell to download the dataset, it throws me a Gateway Timeout error. I've tried it a bunch of times and every time I face the same error.

This is awesome features for power users here. I often spend my huge chunk of time in Kaggle Notebooks / Collab / GCP;

Pros of moving to GCP


Exposing jupyterlab instance using URL on public IP. More on exposing ports and network features in this blog
Full control of Linux environment and one time pip install of packages
Building packages and libraries from source
Integration with other GCP services like AutoML Tables / SQL BigData etc
Access checkpoints/models and predictions on fly. Via jupyter instance or ssh.


Cons of moving to GCP


Uncool Jupyterlab UI and no real time monitoring of effective use of paid hardware and resources. 

Alternatively you can try wandb dashboards and integrate in your flow
No seem less data integration alike Kaggle Notebooks. You can setup kaggle-cli and pull datasets
Collaboration with more than 2 people is tough


Pros of Kaggle Notebooks


Dataset Integration. Private data upload and store for free, also integration with running session's notebook
Resource monitoring is cool feature that will help you to choose effectively and save that 30 hours of GPU use per week
Prebuild setup of latest data science stack without hassel. 

If you want to set up locally or other cloud services. Refer for offical docker-image
Sharable across the community and easily reproducible


Cons of Kaggle Notebooks


No real time logging control on commited notebooks
No on the fly access to saved models/predictions and checkpoints when commiting notebooks
Dual work of session + commits. I wonder if there is a ""magic"" cell point where the work can be always resumed from the given cell in future commits. (Avoid uncessary times taken by !pip installs/ downloading models / loading in memory etc) 


This new feature looks cool. Going to play with it and let you know my further feedbacks and probably a write up to help users choose which of above falls in their bucket. 

&gt; P.S - We never appreciated how much of compute power is offered for free. I literally learnt all data sciences through these notebooks when I couldnt afford atleast a decent laptop for ML/AI. Hope this democratises AI/ML further. Love the work Kaggle / Google does to make education more accessible. Peace",1.0,02/09/2021

891143,159602,2437718,2020-06-18 00:12:34,,"Hi Kagglers,

We‚Äôve heard many of you love Kaggle‚Äôs notebook environment, but sometimes run into limits while you‚Äôre working. Today, we‚Äôre launching a lightweight path for you to easily take your notebooks in Kaggle and run them in a fully customizable compute environment hosted on Google Cloud. 



To get started, you‚Äôll need a billing-enabled Google Cloud project. If you don‚Äôt already have one, you can check out this great tutorial on how to create a project. New accounts qualify for $300 in starting credits!

Once you do have a project set-up, migrating a notebook to Google Cloud is easy. 

Export your Notebook to GCP

First, find a notebook you want to upgrade and select the option to ‚ÄúUpgrade to Google Cloud AI Notebooks‚Äù. This can be found in the three-dot menu when viewing a Notebook, or under the File menu while editing. 



You‚Äôll see a quick modal that will open the Google Cloud Console once you confirm.



Customize your notebook in Google Cloud

Your notebook will open the following page in the Cloud Console, where you can customize your notebook or create one with the preset defaults in one-click.

Here, you can upgrade your machines to have more CPUs, memory or access to higher powered accelerators. You can also choose different environments for your notebook. For your convenience, our environment is selected as a default to make sure all the dependencies you had on Kaggle follow you to Google Cloud. 



Run your notebook in Google Cloud!

In order to give you access to the datasets the Notebook relies on, we add a cell at the top of the Notebook that, once you run it, it downloads and prepares the datasets in the expected path (/kaggle/input). You‚Äôll only have to do this the first time you run your notebook, as the dataset will be stored to your file system (and the download urls will expire). Now you are all set to start running your notebook in Jupyterlab on Google Cloud!



We‚Äôre really looking forward to hearing your feedback as you try this feature and how we can help you improve your experience. Please feel free to drop us a comment below and happy Kaggling!

I‚Äôm happy to share some improvements we‚Äôve made to Kaggle Notebooks. Over the next few days we are introducing a new file tree in the editor! We‚Äôve polished the styling and added a few additional features that we hope make interacting with datasets easier. 

Quickly identify your datasets

You will see that in the new UI you get the thumbnail image from your dataset to make them easier to identify. 



No more inconsistent file names

We‚Äôve also made the names of your files map directly to the file path so that names are consistent throughout the editor. 



Copy file path in one click

We also know that previously it took a few steps to copy dataset file paths. So now we‚Äôre introducing the ability to quickly copy a file path with a quick hover. 



Reliable File Preview

We also updated our file preview functionality in the data explorer to improve the interface and its reliability. You can now reliably open files and preview them directly in the editor. This includes CSVs, JSON, BigQuery, images, and more.



We hope this revamp of the file tree allows you to seamlessly explore your data and inspires you to continue creating new notebooks. There are more improvements we‚Äôre planning, so we‚Äôd love to hear what else would make working with data in notebooks even better. Please let us know what you think!",1.0,06/13/2020

I‚Äôm excited to share some big improvements to Kaggle Notebooks thanks to work by   and  These changes are beginning to roll out through the rest of today and tomorrow.

Less waiting, more coding

Previously, when you started a new Notebook on Kaggle, you‚Äôd often have to wait many seconds or even minutes before it would finish loading. Now, you can start editing right away while the session warms up in the background.



Manage your GPU and TPU resources easier

We‚Äôve also made it easier and faster to turn on and off your interactive session. To turn your interactive session off or on, find the ‚Äústop‚Äù, ‚Äústart‚Äù, and ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù buttons in the top bar or in the ‚ÄúRun‚Äù menu.



For example, turn off your session after saving a new ""Save &amp; Run All"" (commit) version or while you‚Äôre just editing markdown to conserve GPU or TPU quota. Then, when you turn on your session again, you‚Äôll be able to continue editing without interruption even while the session restarts in the background. We hope this change helps you more easily manage your GPU and TPU quota!

Better idle timeouts

Previously, if you left your notebook without editing for 60 minutes, you‚Äôd return to an unpleasant red banner and a blank screen with no obvious way to restart your session. Now, when your interactive session times out you‚Äôll see a dialogue that prompts you to continue editing. 



What do you think?

We would love to hear your thoughts. Are there any other improvements you‚Äôd like to see to make notebooks snappier and easier to use or to better manage your GPU / TPU quotas? Let us know in the comments.

Cheers!

We recently introduced a new feature that lets you load a notebook or script from an external source. This means you can pull in a notebook that's on GitHub, for example, and edit it in on Kaggle.



To use the feature:


Start a new notebook: 
Pick ""Load from URL"" from the file menu
Add a public URL that points to the file you want to load


Give it a try with this simple MNIST convnet example from   

You can also add an ""Open in Kaggle"" badge to a notebook in GitHub or anywhere else. Here's an example:

Today we‚Äôre starting to release a new way to save your work in Notebooks.  Over the next few days, the Commit button will be replaced with a Save Version button, offering a couple of exciting new options:



There are a few more features we hope you‚Äôll like, too. Keep reading for more!

What‚Äôs new

First, you have the option to provide a Version Name.  We heard your feedback, and this feature lets you tag your versions with important information as you iterate or experiment.

Second, you now have two choices when saving a version:


Quick Save skips the top-to-bottom notebook execution and just takes a snapshot of your notebook exactly as it‚Äôs displayed in the editor.  This is a great option for taking a bunch of versions while you‚Äôre still actively experimenting. Quick Save is a brand new way of saving work on Kaggle.

Save &amp; Run All is identical to the ‚ÄúCommit‚Äù behavior you‚Äôre familiar with.


In addition, we‚Äôve revamped the version history experience in the editor.  When you open it, you‚Äôll find all your old favorite options like View Logs and Compare Versions, as well as a few new ones:



Edit Version Name is another way to update the version name, in case you changed your mind since you created the version.  Pin as Default Version sets which version will be shown by default in the notebook viewer, giving you more control over how your notebooks are presented.

What‚Äôs next

We hope you like these new features, but we‚Äôre also eager to hear your feedback! We‚Äôre listening to your input, and we'll be continuing to make improvements in the coming weeks.

this post is a little old and hence out of date, we changed quite a bit since then (see e.g.  Our documentation page is always up to date and contains the current limits. Currently, these are:


For public datasets: 20GB per dataset
For private datasets: 20GB across all your private datasets (you can checkout your account page for information about how much of that is currently used). If all this quota is used up, consider making some of your private datasets public or delete them


One thing to consider: When you upload archive files (zip, rar, gz, ...), we automatically extract those archives - so you don't have to deal with this part in kernels. The limits apply after your data has been decompressed. So, if you upload a 5GB zip file that decompresses to 30GB of raw data, you will see a fail regardless whether you make the dataset public or not.

We‚Äôre excited to introduce the Kaggle extension for JupyterLab, a new way for you to easily browse and download Kaggle Datasets in your own Jupyter environment outside of Kaggle Notebooks!

Here‚Äôs how it works:

Install

Run the following command on your JupyterLab system to install the extension.

jupyter labextension install 

Next time you start JupyterLab you should see a shiny new Kaggle icon on the left panel.


Configure

To use the extension, you‚Äôll need to download your Kaggle API token from your account page.  With the API token you can import it into the extension by dragging &amp; dropping the file into the dotted area or click on the input box to bring up the file browser (1).  Once you imported the file make sure to save the change (2).


Once you save the changes, it will automatically take you to the dataset list panel, but you can always click on the settings icon to update the token.

Work



On the dataset listing page, you can enter a search term in the input box to filter the results. 
Once you find the dataset you‚Äôre  interested in, click on the download icon to download the dataset to your system.

Contribute

But wait, there's more!  We‚Äôre open sourcing the project right away!  We look forward to working with the community to improve the extension for our users.  Simply head over to  and browse the code, file some bugs, request your must have features, or even submit a PR!  Please leave us any feedback and comments you have here!",1.0,11/18/2019

656086,114053,2437718,2019-10-23 22:20:20,,"Hi Kagglers!

We‚Äôre excited to announce a new feature today that will allow you to use secrets (like API Keys, access tokens, etc) more securely in Kernels! We‚Äôve heard this request from many folks in the community that would like to share public code samples without leaking credentials, and we‚Äôre excited to see the awesome Notebooks you create with it. 

The feature is available from the add-on menus in the Notebook Editor: 



You can create new secrets that are associated with your Kaggle account by storing them as key-value pairs, and attach any secrets you would like to be used by the current Notebook. 



Previous secrets that you‚Äôve created with this account will be pre-populated as options to use.



When you use this feature to store and retrieve your secrets we ensure that only your Notebook can access the credential. So, if another user forks your public notebook they‚Äôll need to enter their own individual secrets to match your implementation. However, do make sure you don‚Äôt inadvertently leak your secret after you‚Äôve accessed it within your own Kernel (ie. by printing it to your notebook and then sharing). 

Once you've added a secret to your Notebook, there‚Äôs an easy code snippet you can copy and paste to access your secret!

```
from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient

secret_label = ‚Äúyour-secret-label‚Äù
secret_value = UserSecretsClient().get_secret(secret_label)
```

We look forward to seeing what kind of content the community comes up with using secrets, and please leave comments with your feedback!

649906,91185,2620712,2019-10-15 22:14:50,," this is a great feature and hence I participated in the competition, I do have some suggestions, it would be great to have the below:
- a utility script can be a combination of multiple code snippets in different source files
- be able to add data/non-code related files as part of the utility function
- allow folder structure where code and data can reside in a structured fashion
- allow access to the data area of the notebook via an environment variable or some other method
- allow linking a gist where the code can reside (gist will contain the code for the utility script)
- allow linking a git repo (via branch or commit points) - will contain the code for the utility script)
- allow linking only a folder in a git repo where the code and data resides

The above will help in the following ways:
- keep the main utility script small, simple and modular 
- easy to read, change and use
- can be version controlled via another public SCM system while still visible to the kernel
- keep components of the utility script separate from the data or configuration files in an organised manner

Configuration files can be simple text file but can also be binary files i.e. images or masks or some other kind of file that supports the utility function in its process.

At the moment we can split the main script into smaller parts (I did this for my kernels) but then it's confusing to the end-users and more scripts to manage separately. You can already see that many of the utility functions currently look like a library with all source files merged into a single file, this kinda defeats the ideas mentioned in Utility Script Competition! (September 23rd - Oct 7th).

I hope my suggestions above are reasonable, clear and plausible technically or as per your roadmap.

I'll be happy to hear your thoughts.",,

Suppose i start a GPU kernel then commit it. Then to exit the interactive session, I close the tab.

If I want to start a second GPU session, it says I cant because I have my 1/1 interactive sessions used.

Therefore to start a new GPU session, I have to start a CPU notebook, halt the GPU interactive session, then close the CPU session, then start the GPU interactive session, then halt the CPU session, then commit my second GPU kernel.

i see solutions to this annoying problem: 
1. give us a button that says ""Halt interactive session and return to kernels page"" - clicking this will halt only the interactive session and return to the kernels homepage
2. Halt interactive sessions when closing the tab
3. Halt interactive sessions when you have committed the session, and you close the tab.
4. Give us the ability to halt interactive kernels outside of an interactive session - we can do this from the kernels page kind of, but it's hard because the Interactive and Commit kernels have the same name, so it is hard to know which to Stop",,

Just deployed a small feature to allow stopping all queued / running interactive sessions from the notebook creation page's advanced settings. If you are finding yourself blocked from being able to create a notebook, recommend the following:
- From the listing page, click ""New Notebook"".
- Expand the ""Advanced Settings"".
- If visible, click the STOP INTERACTIVE SESSIONS button.
- Create your notebook or try re-opening the notebook which failed prior.

This will not affect any commit sessions you have running. This button will only be visible if you have interactive sessions queued or running.

606658,105529,836731,2019-08-23 21:18:17,,"Hey Kagglers,

A new feature just launched that allows you to see all your currently active notebook and script sessions from the editor. Now when you are working in a Notebook, you can see other Notebook sessions that are still running in the background and have the option to stop them without leaving the Notebook. This can be helpful if you already have notebooks running and want to stop one to free up resources for your current notebook.

The new interface shows your current sessions broken out into the following categories:


Interactive CPU sessions / limit.
Interactive GPU sessions / limit.
Committing CPU sessions / limit.
Committing GPU sessions / limit.


If you don't have any other sessions running, these limits will not be visible. When visible, you can click on the dropdowns to see all the other  sessions you have running. Each session has a stop button which will immediately kill the session, allowing a new one to start.



Kaggle has always had session limits in place across these categories. This information was just not visible prior to this change. In the past, exceeding session limits would cause new Notebooks to hang with a ""Preparing your kernel..."" banner. We hope this new interface will make it more clear what resources you are currently using.

This feature is intended to improve the reliability of Notebooks by making the limits more transparent and giving you the ability to free up sessions for new work. We will continue to tweak the current limits based on compute availability to make sure we allocate resources to all users fairly.

We are working on improving this interface, especially over the next couple weeks. Please leave suggestions or feedback in this thread!

We heard you when you told us that searching for content on Kaggle can get a little rough. With now over 3 million community members, 20,000 datasets, and 200,000 public notebooks, it is time we take Kaggle‚Äôs search possibilities to the next level. That‚Äôs why we are very excited to unveil the first iteration of our brand new sitewide search! Instead of a small list of results, our sitewide search is now a full search experience and offers everything from filters to recent searches to help you narrow in on the content you want. Don‚Äôt see the new search yet? Don‚Äôt worry. That is because we are incrementally releasing this feature to everyone over the next week so you will see it very soon!

An immersive search experience

Access the sitewide search by clicking on the search bar at the top of the site. Watch the search unfold into a full page experience, displaying your most recent search terms, trending searches on Kaggle, and popular tag categories.



Comprehensive suggested search

When typing in the search bar, you will see suggestions for matching queries and content on the fly. Top suggested results across all types of content on Kaggle will surface instantly for you to explore, all the way from competitions to discussion topics. You can immediately click a result to navigate to it, or click the content category (such as ‚ÄúDatasets‚Äù) to access the full suite of relevant results under that category. Searching for both a wide mixture or narrow types of content is now much easier.



Full search results with powerful filtering options

Want to see more than the suggested results? Just hit enter on your keyboard to set off your search! Here‚Äôs where the full power of the new search is unleashed. Full results are displayed along with a multitude of filters to help you polish and fine-tune your results. You can filter by content category as well as other specifications tailored to the search. Filters also have count visualizations indicating the number of results the filter would return.



We hope the new sitewide search will help you find the content you know and love here at Kaggle. We are actively working on the next iteration so please expect additional features and improvements! And as always, please feel free to leave your feedback in the comments below.",1.0,08/20/2019

We‚Äôve just launched a new feature to make it easy for you to switch between notebooks and scripts in a running Kernel! Now you can toggle between the two on-the-fly.

In the Kernels editor, select File &gt; Kernel Type and choose Script or Notebook from the submenu.



When transitioning from a notebook to a script, the cells are preserved in special comments. This allows us to rehydrate notebook cells if you decide to change a script back into a notebook.

In addition, we‚Äôve made Kernel Theme switching instantaneous. All editor views have been polished to ensure things look good in both the light and dark themes.

Please feel free to provide any feedback about this new feature on this thread.

I'm excited to announce that the Datasets Team has recently a new way to manage the settings of your datasets! Dataset authors can now specify their datasets settings in a single place using a JSON configuration object. üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª



The advantages of using JSON config to update the settings of your dataset include:


Faster updates - rather than fiddling with UI widgets across multiple screens you can update all of your datasets settings in one place
Sharing - simply copy-paste your config object between datasets to share them
Versioning of changes - you can track changes in your datasets settings using your favourite source control management system


Prefer using the UI to configure your settings? No problem! We anticipate this feature will be mostly utilised by our communities power users and will continue to offer and support intuitive UI controls for altering settings alongside JSON Config.

Please don't hesitate to share your feedback concerning JSON Config in the comments below (and stay on the lookout for similar functionality we‚Äôll be adding to our API/CLI tool!)",1.0,06/27/2019

Since the launch of Kernels, one core focus at Kaggle has been to enable robust workflows that can empower tomorrow‚Äôs data scientists to do their best work. Today, over 200,000 public scripts and notebooks exist on our platform, showcasing a plethora of remarkable data science projects. We want to help our community take these projects to the next level by extending the possibilities of what can be done in Kernels.

That is why we are excited to announce that, as of today, Kaggle has officially integrated into BigQuery, Google‚Äôs enterprise cloud data warehouse. In addition to our Python and R environments in Kernels, this integration opens up a third possibility to execute BigQuery‚Äôs renowned, high-performance SQL queries on your massive datasets. Analyzing data is now a faster process using this integration, even on really large datasets. Not to mention, BigQuery has several tiers to support scalable massive data storage and query processing. This integration turns a data scientist‚Äôs workflow into a more seamless process instead of the current fragmented practice, where data storage, querying, cleaning, and analysis would take place across several tools and platforms. Now, all of that can happen right inside BigQuery and Kaggle Kernels!

Another unique feature as part of this integration is BigQuery ML. BigQuery ML is a set of extensions to the SQL language that allows one to easily (in minutes) create, train, and evaluate machine learning models and their predictive performance. For those working in or just starting out in data science, this is an incredibly straightforward way to get started with modeling. Overall, machine learning has effectively become more accessible on Kaggle. 

Getting started with BigQuery on Kaggle

To get started, head to Kaggle Kernels &gt; ‚ÄúNew Kernel‚Äù and spin up a new notebook session. Link the dataset to your Kaggle account by clicking ‚ÄúBigQuery‚Äù on the right-hand sidebar followed by ‚ÄúLink an account‚Äù. Once your account is linked, you can access any datasets stored on your BigQuery account using the BigQuery API Client library. 



You can follow a complete How to use BigQuery on Kaggle tutorial. Or, here‚Äôs a quick example query using the Ames Housing dataset publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, as well as their final sales price. Let‚Äôs compose a query to gain some insights from the data. We want to find out what different home types there are in this dataset, as well as how many do or do not have central air conditioning installed. Here‚Äôs how the query looks inside the Kernels IDE: 



We quickly get a response showing that one-story homes are the most common home style in Ames and that, regardless of home style, most homes have central air conditioning. There are many more public datasets on Kaggle that you can explore in this way.

Building ML models using SQL queries

Aside from data analysis, BigQuery ML lets you create and evaluate machine learning models using SQL queries. With a few queries, any data scientist can build and evaluate regression models without extensive knowledge of machine learning frameworks or programming languages. Let‚Äôs create a linear model that aims to predict the final sales price of real estate in Ames. This model will train on a couple inputs‚Äîliving area size, year built, overall condition, and overall quality. Here‚Äôs the model code:



In just one query, we‚Äôve created a SQL-based ML model inside Kernels. You could continue using Kernels to create more advanced queries for analysis and optimize your model for better results. You may even choose to publish your Kernel to share publicly with the Kaggle community and broader Internet after your analysis is complete. To see the rest of the workflow on obtaining training statistics and evaluating the model, visit the complete How to use BigQuery on Kaggle tutorial. This tutorial is publicly available as a Kernels notebook. You can also check out the Getting started with BigQuery ML kernel that goes into greater depth on training and evaluating models.

Learn more details on navigating the integration by visiting Kaggle‚Äôs documentation. Also, sign up for Kaggle‚Äôs new and updated SQL micro-course that teaches you all the basics of the SQL language using BigQuery. We hope you enjoy using this integration!",1.0,06/25/2019

I am pleased to announce new and shiny improvements to the layout of our Datasets homepage! With over 16,000 datasets on our platform, the ability to effectively search and discover quality content is more important than ever. We are working hard to achieve this goal one step at a time. To start off, we wanted to improve the usability of the search filters and the look-and-feel of the search results. We hope these changes will set the foundation for making dataset search on Kaggle a more pleasant experience.

Have feedback?

Please let us know by posting a comment below in this discussion thread. We are actively working on making the search experience better for you!

In addition, if you made a dataset search and did not find the desired results, we‚Äôd love if you took a minute to answer 3 quick questions on this survey.

What's New?

Front and center search bar

You‚Äôre here to find datasets, so let‚Äôs make that clear! The search bar is now located at the top of the Dataset homepage. The best part? As you scroll down the list of datasets, the bar will follow so you can easily refine your search and alter filters as you go.



Filter menu

To declutter our dataset window and provide a more focused and powerful search experience, we have placed all our filters in a dropdown menu embedded next to the search bar.



The blue chips track filters you‚Äôve applied to your search. Remove a chip to alter your search results easily!

Quick Look and cleaner dataset displays

We re-examined our dataset card displays and realized more information is not necessarily better. Dataset cards now feature only the most important high-level information you need at first glance. 

!( =500x400)

Need more information? Click on the new Quick Look button on a dataset to learn more! The Quick Look modal is designed to make it easier for you to browse and evaluate several datasets without having to click into each individual dataset.

There have been a lot of requests for this feature and we agree that being able to import your own code is an important part of the data science workflow. There are a lot of benefits to importing scripts: 


Make your code more modular. Move functions or parts of your pipeline into a script to keep your notebook tidy. This can make your code easier to read and debug. 
Avoid copying and pasting code.  Are you reusing the same piece of code a lot? Save it in a script and import it into any notebook where you need it. This will save you time and make it less likely that you‚Äôll make errors.
Use the same custom functions in multiple Kaggle Kernels. Maybe you have a set of custom pre-processing functions you always use, or a set of graph themes you‚Äôve made for different publication venues. You can save these as scripts and then easily add them to your current project.


Here‚Äôs how it works!


Create a script kernel with the code you‚Äôd like to import. For some ideas on how to organize this, check out this documentation on Python modules or this guide to writing code for R packages. 
Under the ""File"" menu, click on ""Make Utility Script"". This will let you import this script to notebook kernels. 
Commit your script. When you import a script, you‚Äôre importing the most recent committed version. If you haven‚Äôt committed a version yet, you won‚Äôt see it in the list of scripts you can import. 
Open the notebook where you‚Äôd like to import the script.
Add the script. Under ‚ÄúFile‚Äù, click ‚ÄúAdd utility script‚Äù. Search for the script you want and click to add it. You should see it listed under ‚Äúusr/lib‚Äù in the panel on the right hand side. 
Import your script. In Python you can do this using import nameof_script. In R, you can do this using source(‚Äúpath/to/script‚Äù). The path will be like ../usr/lib/. You can use the TAB button as you type the path to automatically fill out the file path.
Use the functions or objects you‚Äôve imported!

Last summer (for us in the northern hemisphere), we launched our new Data Explorer. This lets you explore data without needing to download it. So, we wanted to make the Data Explorer a focal point on Dataset pages instead of the Description; what‚Äôs more important to Datasets than the data? But, over time we heard from people who come to Kaggle to publish and find public datasets that they missed seeing the Description up-front. In fact, a high quality description is really essential to the usability of the data itself!

We listened to your feedback and I‚Äôm happy to share some of the updates we‚Äôve made that hopefully make it easier for you to understand what a Dataset is all about, including the data.



Here‚Äôs a summary of what‚Äôs changed:


üîÄ The ‚ÄúData‚Äù and ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù tabs are combined into one tab. For those who just want to check out the data itself in the Data Explorer, we made the Description expandable but minimized by default.
üîçWe made the License more prominent; previously it was buried beneath the Description. We heard if you‚Äôre using a data for a work project, for example, knowing a dataset‚Äôs terms of use is really important to know right away.
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èWe consolidated important actions on a Dataset in one place. See the new ‚Äú...‚Äù menu in the Dataset‚Äôs header where you can do things like: create a starter kernel, open the dataset in Data Studio or Google Sheets, and (if you‚Äôre the dataset owner or collaborator) create a new dataset version.


Go check out the World Happiness Report dataset to see the new layout in action or browse the Dataset listing for something that catches your eye.

Finally, we‚Äôre still listening and we have even more upcoming new features that will continue to build on these changes. Let us know in the comments what you think and how we can do more to improve the experience of exploring, publishing, and using Datasets on Kaggle!

I'm excited to announce that the Datasets Team has recently shipped a new and improved dataset creation experience! In addition to uploading files from your local machine, the new uploader includes additional connectors that allow Kagglers to create datasets from various data sources including:


üåΩKernel output files 
:octocat:Public Github repositories
‚òÅÔ∏èAny public file hosted on the web 




GitHub and remote file datasets

Datasets created from a GitHub repository or hosted (remote) files are downloaded directly from the remote server to Kaggle‚Äôs cloud storage and, therefore, will consume none of your local network‚Äôs bandwidth. This makes the remote files connector a convenient solution for creating datasets from large files.

When a dataset is created from a github repository or hosted file the publisher is able to setup a refresh interval from the dataset‚Äôs Settings page. Here‚Äôs an example  created of a stock market dataset that updates daily:



Don‚Äôt want to wait for a refresh? No problem! Click the üîÅ update button within the datasets meatballs menu to sync your dataset immediately.



Note: For GitHub repositories we store the repos zip file in Kaggle‚Äôs cloud storage.

Kernel file datasets

Creating a dataset from a kernel‚Äôs output files will let you create reproducible data pipelines. To create a dataset from a kernel‚Äôs output files, click the &lt;/&gt; icon on the uploader and search for your kernel. 



Alternatively, you can click ‚ÄúCreate Dataset‚Äù from the Output tab on your rendered kernel. Then, select the files you want to use in your dataset.



Limitations

It's worth noting that for user experience and technical simplicity, a dataset can be created and versioned from exclusively one data source. That is, data sources currently can not be mixed and matched in any given dataset (for example, a dataset created from a GitHub repository can't also include files uploaded from your local machine). 

If you would like to use various different data sources in a kernel you can create multiple datasets and add them both to said kernel.

The usual technical specifications for dataset creation also apply to connectors (20GB and 50 top-level files per dataset). See our documentation for more information.

The Kaggle Connector for Data Studio uses the Kaggle API to pull the data on your behalf. If you go through this process for the first time, you will have to provide your Kaggle username and API token (in the password field). If you don‚Äôt have an API token yet, you can create a new one on the 'Account' tab of your user profile ( 

Once this initial connection is established, you will see a dialog for creating a new data source on Data Studio, which should be pre-populated. The process works for both public and private Datasets you have access to.

Click ‚ÄòConnect‚Äô to proceed.



Next, you will be able to make changes to the auto-detected schema. In most cases, you will not need to change anything. Klick ‚ÄòCreate Report‚Äô to compose dashboards or ‚ÄòExplore‚Äô to analyze your data - no coding necessary. See the Data Studio documentation for more details.



This project was a collaboration between Kaggle and the Data Studio Developer team. We hope this will add another resource to your toolkit for analyzing data and finding interesting insights. The Connector code is open source! Feel free to check it out and improve our work.

I think I'm gonna have to disappoint you on that one unfortunately. The Data Explorer is actually made up of a couple of different services that all work together to give you the results you're seeing:


We have a pipeline processing all the dataset files when you upload them. For example, we auto-detect column names and types for CSV files, and we calculate a bunch of metrics for all these columns (e.g. the histograms you're seeing). We cache these results in our database together with the other metadata, so you can the high-level metrics without waiting for calculations.
To browse the actual data, we have a backend service that can read files from different sources and return them to our frontend in a unified way.
And obviously we have the frontend that renders things nicely.


We're really not in a position to open source these things, since they're pretty essential and tied to our overall platform. If you're after the histograms and metrics, maybe you could look at our Kerneler Bot and automatically create similar code that does roughly the same kind of thing?

Read on to learn how to use the API to create and update kernels or check out detailed documentation on our GitHub page.

Create a new kernel

After you follow the installation instructions, it's simple to create a new kernel on Kaggle through the API:


Create a folder containing the kernel source file you want to upload.
Run kaggle kernels init -p /path/to/kernel to generate a metadata file.
Modify the kernel-metadata.json file to contain the necessary metadata for your kernel.
Run kaggle kernels push -p /path/to/kernel to upload and automatically run your kernel.


Working with an existing kernel


Create a folder to download the kernel to
Run kaggle kernels pull -p /path/to/download -k author-username/kernel-name.  


If you want to be able to easily push the code later, you will also want to download the metadata file.  This can be done by adding the -m option to the command: kaggle kernels pull -m -p /path/to/download -k author-username/kernel-name.

At this point, you can now modify your kernel and, if you wish, push the code by running kaggle kernels push -p /path/to/kernel.  

Other features

The API also allows searching and listing kernels, getting the output from a kernel (currently limited to data files), and looking up the run status of the last kernel run.  Please refer to the documentation to learn more.

If you look at the data here  the newest dates are 2018-06-28, which is displayed correctly on the little histogram. However, when you sort the date column in descending order, the rows at the top will have the date 2018-06-26, which is what the newest dates were in the previous version of the dataset.

Making it slightly bizarre, when you move the date slider away from the oldest date to anywhere else, four new rows with the date 2018-06-27 will appear. Leaving, still, four rows with 2018-06-28 hidden.

Correct
That's for string columns, correct. We actually just show the top 2 in the table preview, and 4 in the column view. This really just a UX restriction to make sure the lists are not getting too long.
Mismatched for numeric values should show how many values couldn't be parsed as numeric (e.g. a string value in a numeric column). Looks like this is pretty high for you. I'll investigate and check if we're doing something wrong here.

1. Quick Filter options are really good
2. Appears all numeric values appear to be binned into histograms
3. All object based variables appear as frequency% with top 2 sorted in descending and rest binned as others
4. Once we move the next view apart from the tabular view the values are categorized as mismatched, not sure what is happening there ?

We‚Äôre excited to share that this rollout is now complete and our new ‚ÄúData Explorer‚Äù allows you to maintain and inspect your data in an improved way. 



The top part of this new view shows all you need to know about a dataset‚Äôs data at a glance: 


On the left, you‚Äôll see all files and other data sources. If your
data is tabular, you can quickly scan how many rows and columns it
has. 
The middle column shows the current file‚Äôs description. 
The right column shows the current file‚Äôs column metadata, including data
types, names and descriptions.



The dataframe viewer is the highlight of this redesign. You can use it to explore tabular data:


Select only the columns that you like to see
Filter and sort your data
See aggregate metrics alongside your data
Scroll through all data from top to bottom, not just the first hundred rows


Switch from table to column view to see more metrics for each column, including statistics on the percentage of NULL, common values, and distributions.



This new view will be available for the following data sources:


BigQuery Datasets
SQLite files
CSV files that are smaller than 50mb. Larger files will have custom filters disabled - we‚Äôre working hard on enabling this service for larger files as well.


For all other files, we provide other previews depending on their type. JSON files show a tree-view of their content, archive files show a listing of their contents (check out the new tile view that shows image previews!), and so on. For dataset creators, we also cleaned up our Dataset uploader to make Dataset creation frictionless.

We hope this revamp allows you to explore your data much quicker and inspire you to take your exploratory analyses in Kernels to a deeper level.

I'm a bit late to this post because I (just now) am starting to put together high quality datasets to share to help Stanford with reproducible science.

I would like to share this data also on Kaggle, and I'm wondering if you have thought about ways to share either larger datasets (think of something like mounting a squashfs filesystem, it's read only so could be done at scale from some storage endpoint with FUSE, e.g.,  OR if the only option is to share a subset (in csv? that doesn't seem optimal) and then direct interested users to the real dataset. Finally, have you thought about some logical way to distinguish competition from academic work (where users might collaborate to write a paper together?) I think we badly need high quality datasets, and Kaggle seems like a good contender to get audiences to work on them, albeit the formats and sizes might be challenging.

Read on to learn how to use the API to create and update datasets or check out detailed documentation on our GitHub page.

Create new datasets ¬ª

After you follow the installation instructions, it's simple to create a new dataset on Kaggle from files on your local machine:


Create a folder containing the files you want to upload
Run kaggle datasets init -p /path/to/dataset to generate a metadata file
Add your dataset's metadata to the generated file, datapackage.json
Run kaggle datasets create -p /path/to/dataset to create the dataset


Your dataset will be private by default. You can also add a -u flag to make it public when you create it, or navigate to ""Settings"" &gt; ""Sharing"" from your dataset's page to make it public or share with collaborators.

Update datasets ¬ª

You can also create new versions of existing datasets allowing you to programmatically keep a dataset fresh with the latest data.


Run kaggle datasets init -p /path/to/dataset to generate a metadata file if you don't already have one
Make sure the id field in datapackage.json points to your dataset
Run kaggle datasets version -p /path/to/dataset -m ""Your message here""


For more tips for maintaining your dataset, check out our guide to data publishing. We'll also aim to share more tutorials showing you how to use these features. And if you use the API in a data project, we'd love to hear about it!

This means you can collaborate with others on a private dataset, prepare your datasets privately before making them public, or join a collaborative public dataset. 

Simply select your privacy setting while creating a new Dataset.



Private Datasets

By default, only you can see your private Datasets - you can find them in the ‚ÄúYour Work‚Äù tab of the datasets listing. We added a ‚ÄúSharing‚Äù tab under ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù of each Dataset where you can add collaborators - make and confirm your changes using the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button. Anyone with access to a private Dataset can see it, create Kernels, and use the discussion forum.


Viewers can see the Dataset, but don‚Äôt make any changes. They can remove themselves from the collaborators list. 
Editors can make changes, e.g. edit the description, change images, or create new dataset versions. 
Owners can additionally edit the list of collaborators.


As a dataset owner, you can also switch the visibility of your dataset from private to public in the ‚ÄúSharing‚Äù tab under ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù at any time.



Your quota for private datasets is 20GB across all your private datasets - we‚Äôre counting only the most recent version of each private dataset.

Public Datasets

Public Datasets can still be seen by everyone on Kaggle. Owners of public Datasets can now add editors to their Datasets in the ‚ÄúSharing‚Äù tab under ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù - they have the same rights as with private Datasets. Your can create unlimited public Datasets on Kaggle, however the limit for each public version is 10 GB.

We hope this will improve your workflow for collaborating on data. Please let us know what you think in the comments! We‚Äôll continue to make improvements to this beta release, so your feedback is really valuable to us.",1.0,03/01/2018

As we're getting more contributions and pull requests, I'd like to clarify our API development workflow: As the API contains generated code, we work with two repositories: an internal repository, which contains the settings for generation and the manual code, and an external repository that contains the both manual + generated code. We're doing this mostly for the convenience of avoiding additional build steps in the public repository.

To keep our repositories in sync, unfortunately this means we cannot always directly accept pull requests, as we usually first make changes to our internal repository, generate the code and then move the changes over to the public repository.

We're excited to announce the beta release of the official Kaggle API! The API is made accessible using a command line interface (CLI) implemented in Python. You can now use the CLI to do things like submitting to competitions and downloading datasets. For instructions on using the CLI go to  

Here are some details about the CLI‚Äôs features:


Competitions: search competitions, list data files, download data
files, submit to competitions, and list previous submissions
Datasets: search datasets, list data files, and download data files




We look forward to hearing your feedback on the beta release! We want the API to work well for your needs, so we will prioritize flexible improvements over stability in this initial release. In future we may change the functionality currently offered by the API.

As background, an API has been heavily requested for several years to make submitting to competitions a seamless part of your workflows. We hope the API will be an efficiency boost for Kagglers the world over. And personally it's great being able to release the API as part of my second stint at Kaggle (my first was back in 2011-12)!",1.0,02/01/2018

Plug and Play

This new functionality enables code that is more flexible, reusable, and easier to troubleshoot. With kernels as data sources, you can neatly plug together a data polishing script in R, a visualization script, and a model fitting script in Python without messy dependencies. 

Follow Along

Cleaner and more compartmentalized code makes kernels an even better learning resource. Now your code can follow better practices, making it easier for new data scientists to follow along and for collaborators to pull out the pieces that will help them iterate effectively. 



Adding a Kernel Data Source

Only kernels with data files as output can be used as a data source. There are two ways to add a kernel as a data source:


Click Add a Data Source from within a kernel you are editing. You‚Äôll see that Kernels is now listed alongside Datasets and Competitions in the pop up. You can search for specific kernels using the search box.

First, we've combined entered, active, and completed competitions into one single tab: General. Under the Grouped sort, each grouping is separated and lists the total for each grouping in the header. Changing the sort from Grouped to one of the other sorts merges the three groups back into one big list, sorted based on your selection.

We've also included more details for the competitions you've entered, including your current ranking and the members of your team.

We've also separated InClass competitions into their own tab, and InClass competitions can now be searched.

We know that kernels are a great learning and collaboration resource, but the old listing format made it tricky to find the exact code or analysis you were looking for. Here‚Äôs a comparison of the two listings:



The Public tab (pictured above) has several new and improved features that make locating kernels easier than ever:


Search: Find all your favorite kernels by keyword, or you can search by tag using: tag:
Tagging: Tags are now clickable, allowing you to find related kernels with ease. 
Score: When a kernel has a score, it‚Äôs shown right in the listing itself, letting you see how your kernels perform at a glance.  On a competition‚Äôs kernels page, you can even sort by the best score using the ‚ÄúSort by‚Äù drop down menu.
Filtering: We added two new filters: Categories and Types.  Additionally, each kernel now has four filtering blocks on the right that can be used to restrict the listing to similar kernels.
Sorting: Two new sort options ‚ÄúMost Comments‚Äù and ‚ÄúRecently Created‚Äù make it easy to explore potentially interesting kernels.


The other tabs got some improvements, too.  You‚Äôll notice that the ‚ÄúMine‚Äù tab has been replaced by the ‚ÄúYour Work‚Äù tab, but there‚Äôs one important difference.  Unlike the ‚ÄúMine‚Äù tab, the ‚ÄúYour Work‚Äù tab includes your kernels as well as kernels your teammates have shared with you. This makes it easy to find kernels relevant to your work.  We also added a ‚ÄúFavorites‚Äù tab, a convenient place to see all the kernels you‚Äôve upvoted.

Of course, we didn‚Äôt forget about our mobile users.  The new mobile listing has all the same filtering and searching enhancements as the web version.  We also made the listings more streamlined, which means more listings per page and less scrolling for you.

  Note this announcement is outdated and limits have since changed. Our documentation page is always up to date and contains the current limits. 


Today we‚Äôre pleased to announce a 20x increase to the size limit of datasets you can share on Kaggle Datasets for free! At Kaggle, we‚Äôve seen time and again how open, high quality datasets are the catalysts for scientific progress--and we‚Äôre striving to make it easier for anyone in the world to contribute and collaborate with data.

In addition to allowing dataset sizes up to 10 GB (from 500 MB), Timo on our Datasets engineering team has worked hard to increase resources in other exciting ways, too. Check it out below. 



The increased resources mean that you can more easily:


Share large image and audio datasets (for example, YouTube with Facial Keypoints)
Upload lots more individual files like images for training classification models (like 360,000 Favicon Images); add them to ZIP archives and they‚Äôll be automatically uncompressed on Kaggle and accessible in Kernels
Make continual updates to large datasets or include more historical data (like 12 years of Seattle‚Äôs Public Library Check-Outs)


Also, a reminder that the increased limits are per dataset; as always, you can share any number of data projects with the Kaggle community.

Get started by clicking ‚ÄúNew Dataset‚Äù from the Datasets page.

Plus, writing and sharing reproducible R and Python analyses on larger datasets on Kaggle is also easier with the recent boost to Kernels resources.

We‚Äôd love to know what you think! Do you run into any issues when you publish or update a dataset? Is there anything we can do to make sharing data simpler? Please leave your feedback for Timo and me in the comments.",1.0,11/15/2017

We‚Äôre excited to announce a host of new changes that we believe make Kernels the default place you‚Äôll want to train your competition models, explore open data, and build your data science portfolio. Here‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs changed: 

Additional Computational Resources (doubled and tripled)


Execution time: Now your kernels can run for up to 60 minutes instead of our past 20 minute limit. 
CPUs: Use up to four CPUs for multithreaded workloads..
RAM: Work with twice as much data with 16 GB of RAM available for every kernel.
Disk space: Create killer output with 1 GB of disk space.




Code Tips

Code tips catch common mistakes as you work through coding a kernel. They will pop up when you run code with an identifiable error and significantly cut down your troubleshooting time.



Here are some examples of the most common code tips you‚Äôll run into: 

Although you specified the ""R"" language, you might be writing Python code. Was this intentional? If not, start a Python script instead.

Couldn't show a character. Did you happen to load binary data as text?

Did you mean ""from bs4 import BeautifulSoup""?

Did you mean ""ggplot2""?

Do you mean pandas.DataFrame?

Hidden Cells

You publish public kernels so you can share your data science work to build a portfolio, get feedback, and help others learn. We've added the ability to hide cells, making it possible to present your analysis cleanly so people can focus on what's useful. If viewers want to dig in, it‚Äôs still possible to unhide cells to see the dirty details. 

Improved Reliability

We know how frustrating it is to lose work, get stuck on Kaggle-side errors, or simply have a workbench that‚Äôs down when you‚Äôre trying to get up and running. It‚Äôs a priority of the Kernels engineering team to improve reliability so you can count on your code. Here are a few recent improvements: 


Fewer notebook disconnections
Notebook editor now works with ‚ÄúBlock Third Party Cookies‚Äù browser setting enabled
More reliable notebook auto-save

Tags on Competitions

Whether you‚Äôre looking for references for a new challenge you‚Äôre working on or just want practice on a specific type of problem, you can use tags to easily search for past competitions based on:


Data type: tabular, image, text, and signal (for things like audio or EEG)
Problem type: this includes things like ‚Äúbinary classification‚Äù, ‚Äúobject detection‚Äù and ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù
Topic: quickly find competitions on similar subjects like ‚Äúhousing‚Äù, ‚Äúbanking‚Äù, and lots more




Use the search bar to look up tags using the tag:‚ÄôKEYWORD‚Äô syntax. Or, click on a tag in the listing to filter search results.

On competitions, some additional tags (located at the bottom of the overview pages) will help you learn more about the challenge at a glance: 


Evaluation metric: the usual suspects like logloss, mae, etc. Competitions with custom metrics have a tag pointing you to the ‚ÄúEvaluation"" tab to learn more
Data size: extra small (&lt;50Mb), small (50 to 500Mb), medium (500 to 5Gb), large (5Gb to 10Gb), extra large (10Gb+)


Tags on Kernels

Authors of kernels can now add descriptive tags to their kernels to help readers quickly understand what their code or analysis is about. If you‚Äôve published a kernel, we encourage you to add tags to it which will help make your work more discoverable in the future. For any new kernels, you will be able to add up to five tags once it‚Äôs published.



Here‚Äôs the types of tags you can add:


Audience: use the levels ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù, ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù, and ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù to tell readers the difficulty of your code. Plus, we also added tags for ‚Äútutorial‚Äù and ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù.
Analysis: this category includes techniques like ‚Äútext mining‚Äù and ‚Äúnetwork analysis‚Äù
Machine learning techniques: tell your readers what kind of machine learning techniques you‚Äôre using with tags like ‚Äúclassification‚Äù and ‚Äúfeature engineering‚Äù
Algorithms: for specific types of algorithms, there are tags including ‚Äúknn‚Äù, ‚Äúclustering‚Äù, and ‚Äúgradient boosting‚Äù


What‚Äôs next

We would love to hear your feedback. Let us know what you think about tags on kernels and competitions in the comments. Plus, we‚Äôll let you know when we introduce planned features like search for Kernels that make your work even more discoverable.

Of course, I'm looking forward to the power to delete my test kernels.

I'm assuming that our public kernels are read-or-clone-only to the public. If so, Kaggle would be a great place to build a portfolio.

It would be nice to have an option to add/remove a kernel from our portfolio. And it would be nice to have a field to designate the priority/sort order for kernel positioning within the portfolio.

It would also be nice to make our work viewable to team members, even if we aren't in a competition.

We think this change will greatly expand the types of work you can do on Kaggle. With the recent release of support for multiple data sources in a single script or notebook, robust analyses for work or school are now possible to do on Kaggle and to keep just for you. 

That said, we initially launched Kaggle Kernels without the concept of privacy to build momentum for a culture of public sharing and collaboration. We encourage you to share as much of your work as you can publicly so that our community can continue to push forward the fields of data science and machine learning. 

What‚Äôs new with default privacy?


When you create a new script or notebook, you‚Äôll see a dropdown menu with ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù selected. Running a private kernel means that it is only visible to you AND your competition teammates (if it references a competition dataset). 





The choice to make a kernel Public is permanent. Once you‚Äôve made a script or notebook public, the drop down menu to toggle between Private / Public will disappear. 
To clean up the existing kernels listings, we‚Äôve converted some currently public kernels to be private. This included some hidden kernels and some kernels with no changes and no upvotes. 
We still do not support deleting kernels, but it is on our roadmap.


If you ran kernels in the Two Sigma or March Mania 2017 competitions, this is the same functionality that you used there.

That is a great resource! A great step to democratizing data science! 

Can we assume that we can use any of these data sets in all live competitions too? (e.g. can they be a valid part of any solution?)

Could we also work with them locally if we download them and reference them of we use them for any solution ? Is there an easy way to do download the data sets we want?",3.0,05/03/2017

but I think this is a separate issue that is more about content selection and propagation rather than computing time and server overloading.

For example, right now any one person can run theoretically a kernel after kernel after kernel without limit, making sure that kaggle servers are maximally busy (on his part). If you increase the runtime limit it doesn't change this 'worst case scenario' if one person runs a kernel after kernel after kernel.
So, by enforcing, for example, a simple ""a single user can only run a single kernel at any given time"" constraint, a change like increasing runtime limit shouldn't significantly change the computing power demands of the community. 

Anyway, I have no real knowledge about the technical details of what is possible or not possible technically or financially for kaggle, I just know that I would love to transition as quickly as possible to the phase in which personal computers are no more than a screen and an internet connection, with a complete IDE setup in your browser and all that.

And it kind of feels that kaggle is positioned in the right place to be the vessel that actually makes it happen. Perhaps better positioned than any other company out there.",3.0,05/03/2017

By the way, all that data might require some extra processing power, and kaggle has recently joined forces with google cloud, so am I right in hoping that the memory and runtime limitation be, how should I phrase it, ""alleviated"" a little bit in the near future?

What‚Äôs new?


Kernels now supports querying multiple data sources in a single script or notebook. This means you can access all of the 1300+ datasets on our platform to supplement or drive any analytics project you execute in Kernels. You can query both our open data and competitions platforms in the same kernel. Don‚Äôt see the data you need for a project? You can upload any table or dataset to kaggle.com/datasets and then use it in your analysis. There is a 100 GB limit on the data sources associated with any one kernel. 

You can click ‚ÄúNew Kernel‚Äù on kaggle.com/kernels (and other relevant site pages) to quickly spin up a new script or notebook. Start by selecting one data source, and click ‚ÄúAdd a Data Source‚Äù at any point to include more. 

There is an Input tab on every kernel where you can view the datasets and files that are referenced in the code. 

You can fork any kernel and change the data source to run the same code on a different dataset. 
Kernel URLs no longer include the name of the dataset or competition. They follow this format: 



  kaggle.com/



File paths need to be updated after adding a second+ data source. When you add two or more data sources, the dataset files will all be located at:



  ../input/



Kernels can be run without any associated data. You can now create data source free kernels (to do things like data simulations). All kernels without data can be seen here.

Aurelio and Myles are the lead members of our product team that worked on this project. They‚Äôll be keeping an eye on this discussion to answer questions and take feedback. ",1.0,05/02/2017
